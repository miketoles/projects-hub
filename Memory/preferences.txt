# Preferences

How Mike likes things done. Claude should follow these unless asked otherwise.

## Communication Style

- Direct and concise, not verbose
- Tables over paragraphs when comparing options
- Show options and tradeoffs, let Mike decide
- Don’t repeat back what Mike just said
- Don’t pad responses with unnecessary caveats
- End naturally - no “let me know if you have questions”

## Code Style

- Functions over classes (unless classes make clear sense)
- Explicit over clever
- Comments explain “why”, not “what”
- TypeScript with strict mode when using TS
- Meaningful variable names, no abbreviations except common ones (id, url, etc.)

## Tech Preferences

- **Frontend:** React 18, Vite (not CRA), Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (not Fastify or Hono unless discussed)
- **Database:** SQLite with better-sqlite3 (not Prisma, not Postgres unless needed)
- **Auth:** Simple as possible. No login if avoidable.
- **Licensing:** MIT/Apache/Public Domain only. No GPL3 concerns, no corporate lock-in.

## Documentation Style

- Comprehensive design docs before building
- Multiple audiences in one doc when possible (technical + non-technical)
- Tables for specs and comparisons
- ASCII diagrams for architecture
- Real examples, not abstract descriptions

## Tools

- VS Code for editing
- Claude Code for development
- Git for everything
- Markdown for all docs
- GitHub for repos

## Pet Peeves

- Don’t apologize excessively
- Don’t ask “would you like me to…” repeatedly - suggest or do
- Don’t suggest deprecated tools (CRA, older patterns)
- Don’t add features I didn’t ask for without mentioning it
- Don’t create README files unless asked

## Learned Corrections

*Things Claude got wrong and Mike corrected. Check these before suggesting.*

- [2026-01-30] jsDelivr caches aggressively - use commit-hash URLs, not branch names
- [2026-01-30] Don’t suggest Prisma for SQLite projects - use better-sqlite3
- [2026-01-30] Code block labels (```bash) are syntax highlighting hints, not shell indicators
