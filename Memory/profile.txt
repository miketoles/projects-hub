## Role

Developer at Craig Hospital on the Neurorehabilitation Team (NRT). Building tools to replace CentralReach for ABA/TBI patient behavioral data collection and analysis.

## Technical Background

- Full-stack developer comfortable with React, Node, Python, Swift
- Prefers understanding history and principles before diving into implementation
- Likes clean, open-source stacks without corporate lock-in
- Values comprehensive documentation that serves multiple audiences
- Uses Mac for development, targets hospital infrastructure for deployment

## Work Context

- **Team:** CNAs/Techs (hands-on patient care), RBTs (data entry), BCBAs (analysis), Program Manager (reporting)
- **Patients:** Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- **Constraints:** HIPAA considerations, 7-year BACB retention requirement, hospital IT policies
- **Current pain:** CentralReach is slow, clunky, expensive. Manual Excel graphing. Hundreds of clicks per patient.

## Personal

- Has a grandson - builds games for him (Bulldozer, Moon Rocks, Shipwreck Explorer)
- Interested in game development as a creative outlet
- Values understanding “why” things work, not just “how”
- Appreciates when tools and systems are designed for independence (low bus factor)

## How I Work

- Design docs before code - think it through first
- Prefer iterative progress with working software at each step
- Like to talk through problems before jumping to solutions
- Keep multiple projects active, switch based on energy and priority
- Use Claude across mobile, desktop, and Claude Code - need continuity between them

## Current Focus (January 2026)

- **Primary:** NRT Scatterplot System - design complete, ready to build
- **Secondary:** Game testing and polish (Moon Rocks, Shipwreck Explorer)
- **Background:** MikeText (complete), 3dArchery (expanding)
