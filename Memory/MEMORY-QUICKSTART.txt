# Memory System - Quick Start

## Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Copy files to projects-hub

Put the MEMORY folder in your projects-hub:

```
~/projects-hub/
├── MEMORY/
│   ├── MEMORY-SYSTEM.md
│   ├── profile.md
│   ├── preferences.md
│   ├── recent.md
│   ├── learnings.md
│   └── projects/
│       └── nrt.md
├── SYNC.md          (keep existing)
├── ACTIVE.md        (keep existing)
└── PROJECTS.md      (keep existing)
```

### 2. Add to CLAUDE.md

Add this to your Claude Code CLAUDE.md file:

```markdown
## Memory System

### On "Sync Up" Command (works anytime)
1. If memory files haven't been read this session, read them first
2. Append 3-5 line summary to recent.md (date + interface + bullets)
3. Add any new learnings to learnings.md
4. Update projects/[project].md if decisions were made
5. Commit and push
6. Provide commit-hash URL for mobile/desktop sync

"Sync up" = get current + save state. One command.
```

### 3. Commit and push

```bash
cd ~/projects-hub
git add -A
git commit -m "Add memory system"
git push
```

### 4. Test it

Start a CC session and say: “Read my memory files”

-----

## Daily Use

**CC sessions:** Just work. Say “sync up” when done.

**Mobile/Desktop:** Paste the commit-hash URL from CC, or upload memory files from iCloud.

**That’s it.**
