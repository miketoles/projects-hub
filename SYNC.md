## Current Focus

**Project:** NRT Core (Nurse Resource Tool)
**Path:** `~/dev/NRT/core/frontend` + `~/dev/NRT/core/backend`
**Branch:** main
**Run:** `npm run dev` in both → frontend http://localhost:5175, backend http://127.0.0.1:3003

## What We Did This Session

- Triaged 3 feature requests into `tasks/todo.md` backlog:
  1. PatientsView master-detail layout redesign [mike]
  2. "ID: " prefix on patient identifiers [mike]
  3. Scatterplot draft/save model redesign — no DB writes until explicit save, blank vs x visual distinction, date guard (no today/future), deep planning required [mike]

## What's Next

- [ ] **IT meeting Monday** — B1 environment access, dev server setup ← NEXT
- [ ] Continue collecting triage feedback from Ari + Mike's own testing
- [ ] When ready: deep plan for scatterplot save model redesign (biggest backlog item)
- [ ] When ready: ui-expert agent + /plan for PatientsView layout

## Open Questions

- B1 environment: what does IT need from us Monday?
- More triage items expected from Ari testing

## Notes for Mobile Session

Monday IT meeting prep. Think about what questions to bring re: TLS/proxy/AD setup. Keep testing the prototype and triaging feedback — backlog is growing nicely.
