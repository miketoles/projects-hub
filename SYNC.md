## What We Did This Session

- Submitted D&B DUNS number application (BIR form, financial statement, CO Articles of Org, EIN letter)
- Updated spiritlogic.dev landing page for Apple Developer enrollment (company info, products, contact email, footer)
- Reviewed Cycles 41-43 (UX polish, deploy/marketing) — all PASS
- Cleaned up 28 uncommitted files from Cycles 37-41, committed in 4 logical groups and pushed
- Added Tier 1 animal target art pack: 15 wildlife illustrations (1536x1024 PNG) + scoring-zones.json
- STX Archery Netlify deploy live with new landing page + privacy policy

---

## Current State

STX Archery v3.0 is feature-complete through Cycle 44. All 22 scoring engines built (151 tests), full app integration (scoring, equipment, GPS, weather, stats, export), premium/IAP via RevenueCat, promo code system, and marketing landing page deployed to Netlify. 29 test suites / 171 tests passing. Animal art pack (15 animals) committed with placeholder scoring zones. spiritlogic.dev updated with real company presence. Repo is fully clean.

## What's Next

- [ ] Wait for DUNS number → Apple Developer Organization enrollment + Google Play ← BLOCKED
- [ ] Get mule deer doe image from ChatGPT (16th animal, pending)
- [ ] Step 22: App Store submission (EAS builds, real RevenueCat API keys, store assets)
- [ ] Tune animal scoring zones against actual images (refine vitalCenter/radius values)
- [ ] Step 23: CC Final Gate Report (ship/no-ship checklist)

---

## Open Questions

- DUNS number pending — blocks Apple Developer + Google Play enrollment
- Mule deer doe image still pending from ChatGPT (15 of 16 animals committed)
- Android build not yet tested (deferred to Step 22)
- Animal scoring zone coordinates are placeholder estimates — need visual overlay tuning

## Notes for Mobile Session

STX Archery is essentially done. 44 cycles of CC+Codex collaboration took it from architecture plan to feature-complete app with marketing site. The remaining work is all submission/deployment: EAS builds, API keys, store listing, and the final gate review. The animal art pack adds visual polish for 3D target rendering.
