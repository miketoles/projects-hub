# Sync File for Claude

*Last synced: January 26, 2026 by Claude Code*

Hey Claude! Mike is continuing work from his phone. Here's the current context:

## What I Was Just Working On

**Project:** ScatterplotCreator
**Path:** `~/dev/ScatterplotCreator`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/miketoles/Scatterplot
**Last session:**
- Fixed grey backgrounds not printing (darkened from #f2f2f2 to #e0e0e0)
- Fixed Print All PDF sorting by patient ID
- Increased font sizes for better print readability (12px headers, descriptions, instructions)
- Removed "Behaviors for data collection" line
- Pushed all changes to GitHub

**Next up:** Continue gathering stakeholder feedback

**Open questions:** None - awaiting more feedback

## Current Mental Context

ScatterplotCreator is in stakeholder review. First round of feedback addressed (font sizes, grey printing). App is deployed and being tested by BCBAs.

Main focus areas:
1. ScatterplotCreator - address any additional feedback
2. 3dArchery indoor scoring expansion
3. hospital-mini-apps development
