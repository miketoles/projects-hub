## What We Did This Session

- Reviewed Codex Cycle 49 B2 build (Animal Selector UI + Course Templates) — PASS with 2 required + 5 should-fix
- Codex applied all 7 fixes in Cycle 51 — reviewed and APPROVED FOR MERGE
- B2 complete: Hybrid C+A animal selector (auto-rotate + bottom drawer override), local SQLite course templates, shoot screen integration, course picker in create flow
- 37 suites / 223 tests, all gates green
- Recovered from Claude Desktop crash — full context rebuilt in VS Code plugin

---

## Current State

B2 (Animal Selector + Course Templates) is approved for merge. Mike is sim-testing now. The app has 22+ scoring engines, PNG animal renderer, elliptical zone scoring, and now animal selector with course memory. B1 (PNG renderer) and B2 both complete. DUNS number pending for Apple Developer enrollment.

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Mike: Sim-test B2 (animal pill, drawer, course picker) ← IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Merge B2 to main after sim verification
- [ ] DUNS number → Apple Developer enrollment ($99/year)
- [ ] Step 22: App Store submission (EAS builds, API keys, store assets)

---

## Open Questions / Mental Context

- App Store submission blocked on DUNS → Apple Developer enrollment
- ScatterplotCreator full review still unscheduled
- NRT prototype zip needs to go to Ari for extended testing

---

## Notes for Mobile Session

- B2 is the last major feature before App Store submission
- If sim testing passes, only infrastructure steps remain (DUNS, enrollment, EAS builds)
- Good time to think about App Store listing copy, screenshots, pricing strategy
