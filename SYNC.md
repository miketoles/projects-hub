## What We Did This Session

- Renamed project from CR → NRT (Neurorehabilitation Team)
- Established two-track approach: Quick Win + Full Platform
- Updated all project files and references
- Created DESIGN.md skeleton for comprehensive planning
- Added database backup utility
- Added Mike's auth philosophy to CLAUDE.md

---

## Current State

**Track 1 (Quick Win):** Scatterplot data entry app is functional
- ScatterplotGrid (96 intervals, click+drag)
- Client/behavior management
- SQLite database with backup utility

**Track 2 (Full Platform):** DESIGN.md created, ready for brainstorming

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Flesh out DESIGN.md with TBI/ABA model details
- [ ] Excel export for scatterplot reports
- [ ] Remove login requirement (AD/Windows auth)
- [ ] Test with real team members

---

## Open Questions / Mental Context

- NRT is potentially a complete CentralReach replacement
- Craig Hospital is the only facility in the world using ABA for TBI patients
- Need to deeply understand TBI/ABA workflows before building further
- Quick win should ship fast, but architecture must support full vision

---

## Notes for Mobile Session

Ready to brainstorm the TBI/ABA model and what makes Craig Hospital's approach unique. This will inform DESIGN.md and ensure the platform truly serves the team's needs.

Key questions:
- What workflows are unique to TBI vs traditional ABA?
- What does CentralReach do poorly for your use case?
- What would make RBTs and BCBAs love this tool?
