## Current Focus

**Project:** NRT Core (Nurse Resource Tool)
**Repo:** https://github.com/miketoles/NRT
**Path:** `~/dev/NRT/core/frontend` + `~/dev/NRT/core/backend`
**Run:** `npm run dev` in both → frontend http://localhost:5175, backend http://127.0.0.1:3003

---

## What We Did This Session

- Created **NRT Unified Master Plan** at `~/dev/NRT/docs/NRT-MASTER-PLAN.md` (588 lines, 12 sections)
- Codex reviewed and applied 3 Medium fixes (inventory timing, A0 deliverable, bundle directory clarification)
- Agent A (Claude Code) reviewed Codex edits — all verified clean
- Agent A signed off. Agent B + Mike sign-off pending.

---

## Current State

Phases 0-2 complete. Feb 5 review cycle resolved all 18 risks. 40 backend tests, zero frontend tests. Master plan is finalized with all findings resolved. Awaiting Agent B review and Mike sign-off before Phase A begins.

---

## What's Next

- [ ] **Agent B: Review master plan** ← START HERE
- [ ] Mike: Resolve Conflict Register items CR1-CR4
- [ ] Both agents + Mike sign off (Section 12 of master plan)
- [ ] Phase A: Testing framework (~3 days, starts after sign-off)

---

## Open Questions / Mental Context

- **Master plan:** `~/dev/NRT/docs/NRT-MASTER-PLAN.md` — all 3 review findings fixed, ready for sign-off
- **4 Conflicts needing Mike's input:**
  - CR1: STATUS.md says "Phase 3: Offline" but offline is removed → recommend update
  - CR2: System Design doc has offline specs → recommend mark as "Future/ABA only"
  - CR3: UI/UX Plan Phases 3-5 unsequenced → recommend defer to backlog
  - CR4: Two SDE specs at different paths → recommend authoritative is `~/dev/NRT/docs/SDE Scatterplot Data Entry Design.md`

---

## Notes for Mobile Session

**Agent B: Review `~/dev/NRT/docs/NRT-MASTER-PLAN.md` Section 12 checklist:**
1. Plan completeness — no orphaned items?
2. Phase sequence — dependencies make sense?
3. Review process — executable by any agent?
4. Ari feedback path — clear?
5. Corrections review decision — sound?
6. Could hand to Craig Hospital IT?
7. Any unresolved concerns?

**Mike: Resolve CR1-CR4 in Conflict Register (Section 3.1).**
