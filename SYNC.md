# Sync File for Claude

*Last synced: January 27, 2026 by Claude Code*

Hey Claude! Mike is continuing work from his phone. Here's the current context:

---

## What I Was Just Working On

**Project:** CR (Scatterplot Quick Entry Tool)
**Path:** `~/dev/CR`
**Last session:**
- Identified primary use case: faster scatterplot data entry
- Designed click+drag UI for filling 96-interval grids
- Built working prototype: `mockup/quick-entry.html`
- Prototype ready for user testing

**Next up:** Test prototype with real paper scatterplots

**Open questions:** What improvements needed after testing?

## Current Mental Context

Started exploring CentralReach API for potential hospital integrations. This is early-stage - no credentials yet. Could potentially integrate with ScatterplotCreator or hospital-mini-apps.

Main focus areas:
1. CR - find path to API credentials
2. ScatterplotCreator - in stakeholder review
3. 3dArchery indoor scoring expansion
4. hospital-mini-apps development

## Quick Status: Active Projects

| Project | Status | Next Action |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| CR | Exploratory | Find CR admin for API access |
| ScatterplotCreator | In stakeholder review | Address feedback |
| 3dArchery | Expanding to v2 | Add Indoor scoring modes |
| hospital-mini-apps | In development | Continue building |
| polymarket-arb-bot | Running | Monitor |

## Notes for This Mobile Session

Things to think about:
- Any additional stakeholder feedback for ScatterplotCreator
- Indoor archery scoring UI design
- Quiz App feature prioritization
