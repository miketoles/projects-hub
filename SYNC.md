## Current Focus

**Project:** STX Archery (formerly 3D Archery Score Tracker)
**Repo:** https://github.com/miketoles/3darchery
**Path:** `~/dev/3dArchery`
**Run:** `npx expo start` (Expo dev server, iOS simulator)

---

## What We Did This Session

- Reviewed Cycles 41-43 (UX polish, deploy/marketing) — all PASS
- Cleaned up 28 uncommitted files from Cycles 37-41, committed in 4 logical groups and pushed
- Updated spiritlogic.dev landing page for Apple Developer enrollment (real company info, products, focus areas)
- Added Tier 1 animal target art pack: 15 realistic wildlife illustrations (1536x1024 PNG) + scoring-zones.json
- STX Archery Netlify deploy live with new landing page + privacy policy

---

## Current State

STX Archery v3.0 is feature-complete through Cycle 44. All 22 scoring engines built (151 tests), full app integration (scoring, equipment, GPS, weather, stats, export), premium/IAP via RevenueCat, promo code system, and marketing landing page deployed to Netlify. 29 test suites / 171 tests passing. Animal art pack (15 animals) committed with placeholder scoring zones. spiritlogic.dev updated with real company presence. Repo is fully clean.

---

## What's Next

- [ ] Step 22: App Store submission (EAS builds, real RevenueCat API keys, store assets) ← START HERE
- [ ] Tune animal scoring zones against actual images (refine vitalCenter/radius values)
- [ ] App icon finalization (1024x1024 for App Store)
- [ ] Step 23: CC Final Gate Report (ship/no-ship checklist)
- [ ] Apple Developer Organization enrollment (spiritlogic.dev is ready for review)

---

## Open Questions

- Android build not yet tested (deferred to Step 22)
- Animal scoring zone coordinates are placeholder estimates — need visual overlay tuning
- Apple Developer enrollment timing: spiritlogic.dev landing page is live, ready for Apple review

## Notes for Mobile Session

STX Archery is essentially done. 44 cycles of CC+Codex collaboration took it from architecture plan to feature-complete app with marketing site. The remaining work is all submission/deployment: EAS builds, API keys, store listing, and the final gate review. The animal art pack adds visual polish for 3D target rendering.
