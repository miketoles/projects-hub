## Current Focus

**Project:** NRT Core (Nurse Resource Tool)
**Path:** `~/dev/NRT/core/frontend` + `~/dev/NRT/core/backend`
**Branch:** main
**Run:** `npm run dev` in both → frontend http://localhost:5175, backend http://127.0.0.1:3003

## What We Did This Session

- Fresh session start — no new code changes yet

## What's Next

- [ ] **B1 environment access** — TLS/proxy/AD header trust verification ← START HERE
- [ ] Phase D Track B: backup scheduling, post-deploy smoke test
- [ ] B2 backlog: full TypeScript strict-mode fix (Option 1) — deferred

## Open Questions

- B1 environment timeline: who provides access, what IT coordination is needed?

## Notes for Mobile Session

Think about B1 logistics and whether to hand Ari the fresh prototype zip (~54MB) now or wait for deployment.
